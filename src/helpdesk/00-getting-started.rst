What is Gorgias Helpdesk?

Gorgias helpdesk is a support platform integrated with all your apps.
You can connect Shopify, your own back-office, or any app you want.
When a customer contacts you, you see the full profile of the customer. You can respond to them and take actions on the
customer's account, like giving them a gift card.

TL;DR: To start responding to your customers with Gorgias, follow these 3 quick steps:

    1. `Create a Gorgias account <https://welcome.gorgias.io/register>`_

    2. Forward your support emails to support@{account-name}.gorgias.io.
